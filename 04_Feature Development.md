  - Each tutorial should have a clear structure:
    - Title
    - Introduction
    - Code examples
    - Exercises or quizzes to reinforce learning
- **Code Examples**:
  - Real-world scenarios demonstrating Python concepts.
  - Interactive code snippets that users can edit and run directly on the site.

##### Implementation Steps
1. **Create a Model**:
   - Define a `Tutorial` model with fields for title, content, category, and any associated resources.
   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class Tutorial(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
       content = models.TextField()
       category = models.CharField(max_length=50)
       created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
   ```

2. **Build Views**:
   - Create views to list tutorials and display individual tutorial details.
   ```python
   from django.shortcuts import render
   from .models import Tutorial

   def tutorial_list(request):
       tutorials = Tutorial.objects.all()
       return render(request, 'tutorials/list.html', {'tutorials': tutorials})

   def tutorial_detail(request, pk):
       tutorial = Tutorial.objects.get(pk=pk)
       return render(request, 'tutorials/detail.html', {'tutorial': tutorial})
   ```

3. **Set Up URLs**:
   - Map URLs to the corresponding views.
   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from . import views

   urlpatterns = [
       path('tutorials/', views.tutorial_list, name='tutorial_list'),
       path('tutorials/<int:pk>/', views.tutorial_detail, name='tutorial_detail'),
   ]
   ```

4. **Create Templates**:
   - Develop HTML templates for listing and detailing tutorials.
   - Use Bootstrap for responsive design and aesthetics.

       title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
       description = models.TextField()
       difficulty = models.CharField(max_length=20)
       created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
   ```

2. **Submission Model**:
   - Create a `Submission` model to track user submissions and their results.
   ```python
   class Submission(models.Model):
       challenge = models.ForeignKey(Challenge, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       code = models.TextField()
       result = models.TextField()
       submitted_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
   ```

3. **Evaluate Submissions**:
   - Use a code execution service or create a secure API to evaluate submitted code.
   - Provide feedback based on test cases (pass/fail) and performance.

4. **Set Up Views and URLs**:
   - Create views for displaying challenges and handling submissions.
   - Define URL patterns accordingly.

5. **Create Templates**:
   - Design templates for listing challenges and displaying submission results.

       content = models.TextField()
       user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

   class Answer(models.Model):
       question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       content = models.TextField()
       user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
       upvotes = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
   ```
